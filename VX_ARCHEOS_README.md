## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy scipy pyyaml

# Test the system
python vx_unified.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from vx_unified import VXUnifiedSystem

# Initialize system
system = VXUnifiedSystem()

# Pattern recognition
result = system.reason_about(
    "What is the next number in the sequence?",
    context={'sequence': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]}
)
print(result['conclusions'])  # [12]
```

### Advanced Usage - First-Order Logic

```python
from vx_advanced_core import ResolutionProver, Predicate, Term

prover = ResolutionProver()

# Define predicates
Human = lambda x: Predicate("Human", (x,))
Mortal = lambda x: Predicate("Mortal", (x,))

# Add facts and rules
socrates = Term.const("Socrates")
X = Term.var("X")

prover.add_fact(Human(socrates))
prover.add_rule([Human(X)], Mortal(X))

# Prove theorem
goal = Mortal(socrates)
success, proof = prover.prove(goal)
print(f"Proven: {success}")  # True
```

### Causal Discovery

```python
import numpy as np
from vx_advanced_core import PCAlgorithm

# Generate data: X -> Y -> Z
n = 500
X = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, n)
Y = np.random.binomial(1, 0.3 + 0.4 * X)
Z = np.random.binomial(1, 0.2 + 0.5 * Y)
data = np.column_stack([X, Y, Z])

# Learn causal structure
pc = PCAlgorithm(alpha=0.05)
graph = pc.learn_structure(data, ['X', 'Y', 'Z'])
print(graph.to_dict())
```

### Analogical Reasoning

```python
from vx_advanced_core import StructureMapping, Structure

# Define structures
solar_system = Structure(
    entities={'sun', 'planet'},
    relations={
        ('attracts', 'sun', 'planet'),
        ('revolves_around', 'planet', 'sun')
    },
    attributes={}
)

atom = Structure(
    entities={'nucleus', 'electron'},
    relations={
        ('attracts', 'nucleus', 'electron'),
        ('revolves_around', 'electron', 'nucleus')
    },
    attributes={}
)

# Find structural mapping
mapper = StructureMapping()
mappings = mapper.map_structures(solar_system, atom)
print(mappings[0]['mapping'])
# {'sun': 'nucleus', 'planet': 'electron'}
```

### Constraint Satisfaction

```python
from vx_extended import ConstraintSatisfactionSolver

solver = ConstraintSatisfactionSolver()

# 4-Queens problem
for i in range(4):
    solver.add_variable(f"Q{i}", set(range(4)))

def no_attack(assignment, i, j):
    if f"Q{i}" not in assignment or f"Q{j}" not in assignment:
        return True
    qi, qj = assignment[f"Q{i}"], assignment[f"Q{j}"]
    return qi != qj and abs(qi - qj) != abs(i - j)

for i in range(4):
    for j in range(i+1, 4):
        solver.add_constraint(
            (f"Q{i}", f"Q{j}"),
            lambda a, i=i, j=j: no_attack(a, i, j)
        )

solutions = solver.solve()
print(solutions[0])  # Valid solution
```
